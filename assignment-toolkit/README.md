Follow the interactive wizard to create your assignment.

### 4. Validate Assignment

```bash
assignment-toolkit validate my-assignment.yaml
```

```bash
assignment-toolkit sync my-assignment.yaml
```

## üìù Assignment Format

Assignments are stored in YAML format for easy editing and version control:

```yaml

## üì¶ Commands Reference

### Core Commands

- `init` - Initialize assignment workspace
- `create [type]` - Create new assignment interactively
- `validate [file]` - Validate assignment package
- `list` - List all assignments in directory
- `sync [file]` - Sync assignment with LMS
- `package [file]` - Create distributable package

- `config get [key]` - Get configuration value
- `config list` - List all configuration

## üîß Configuration

The toolkit uses `.assignment-config.yaml` for configuration:

```yaml
author: "Your Name"
email: "your.email@example.com"
license: "CC-BY-SA-4.0"
language: "en"
lms_endpoint: "https://your-lms.com"
api_key: "your-api-key"

defaults:
  points: "1"
  auto_grade: "true"
  published: "true"
  quarter: "Q1"

templates:
  multiple-choice: "./templates/multiple-choice.yaml"
  writing: "./templates/writing.yaml"
```

## üîÑ Workflow Examples

### Offline Assignment Creation

```bash
# Initialize workspace
assignment-toolkit init

# Create multiple assignments offline
assignment-toolkit create multiple-choice
assignment-toolkit create writing
assignment-toolkit create code-submission

# Validate all assignments
for file in *.yaml; do
  assignment-toolkit validate "$file"
done

# When online, sync all assignments
for file in *.yaml; do
  assignment-toolkit sync "$file"
done
```

### Template-Based Development

```bash
# Create a template
assignment-toolkit template create

# Use template for new assignments
assignment-toolkit template use multiple-choice
assignment-toolkit template use writing-essay
```

### Batch Operations

```bash
# Package all assignments for distribution
for file in *.yaml; do
  assignment-toolkit package "$file"
done

# Validate entire directory
assignment-toolkit validate-all
```

## üîí Security Considerations

- API keys are stored in local configuration files
- Use environment variables for sensitive data in CI/CD
- Assignment files can be version controlled safely
- Resource files should be managed separately for large files

## ü§ù Integration with LMS

The toolkit integrates with your LMS through REST API:

- **Authentication**: Bearer token or API key
- **Assignment Import**: POST `/api/assignments`
- **Resource Upload**: POST `/api/resources`
- **Batch Operations**: POST `/api/assignments/batch`

### Required LMS Endpoints

Your LMS should support these endpoints:

```
GET  /api/auth/me                    # Test authentication
POST /api/assignments                # Create assignment
POST /api/resources                  # Upload resource
GET  /api/assignments?sourceHash=X   # Check for duplicates
```

## üìä Quality Scoring

The validator assigns quality scores (0-100) based on:

- **Required Fields** (40 points): Title, type, questions
- **Educational Content** (30 points): Description, learning objectives
- **Technical Quality** (20 points): Proper formatting, validation
- **Completeness** (10 points): Resources, metadata

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Assignment validation fails**
- Check required fields are present
- Verify question format matches assignment type
- Ensure YAML syntax is correct

**Sync fails with authentication error**
- Verify LMS endpoint is correct
- Check API key is valid and has proper permissions
- Test connection with `assignment-toolkit config test`

**Resource upload fails**
- Check file paths are correct
- Verify file sizes are within limits
- Ensure file types are supported by LMS

### Debug Mode

Enable debug output:
```bash
export DEBUG=true
assignment-toolkit sync my-assignment.yaml
```

## üìö Examples Directory

Check the `examples/` directory for sample assignments:

- `examples/multiple-choice-basic.yaml`
- `examples/matching-geography.yaml`
- `examples/code-submission-python.yaml`
- `examples/writing-essay.yaml`

## üîÆ Roadmap

- [ ] GUI interface for non-technical users
- [ ] Advanced question types (drag-and-drop, hotspot)
- [ ] Integration with popular LMS platforms
- [ ] Assignment analytics and reporting
- [ ] Collaborative editing features
- [ ] Mobile app for assignment creation
